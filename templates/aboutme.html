                    I am 21 years old. I am not tall  but I weigh about 150 lbs (68 kgs). My eyesight is a little weak mostly because of the
                    long hours I spend in-front of display terminals. First thing, I do not like being social - 
                    mostly because I do not know what it exactly means! I belong to a very diverse Indian joint family of more than 15 people.
                    I like music + hot cappuccino + black / green terminal and that is why I am often seen with all three of it. Like most
                    engineers in India, I usually sleep late at night. I like watching movies, music videos, TV Shows, Animes and Documentaries.
                    Apart from Computer Science, I am also interested in particle physics. My Primary Gods include -Stephen Hawking,
                    Steve Jobs and Alan Turing.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    My failures have motivated me more than my achievements. I work as hard as possible. I am usually good at working under pressure
                      with an upcoming deadline to meet. I also like self-learning usually via <b>web</b>. I hate reading books - novels, technical,
                    academic, etc - all of it. I am not patient enough to read a whole book. I love debating especially technical debate among
                    a small set of people. I am rarely angry. I am a non vegetarian and like trying out new dishes and cuisine. I maintain a digital
                    diary and occasionally write stuff.
                  </p>

                    I grew up in Hathwa, India along with a number of cousins. So my childhood was a happy one (:P). I was only an above-average
                    student at my primary school. I was always good with Mathematics. After primary education, I attended Resonance to Prepare for IIT JEE.
                      It played a pivotal role in my academic career. However, I failed to get a branch of my
                    choice in any of the IITs and  NITs thus I joined RNS Institute of Technology, Bangalore. I made a lot of friends here. I learn a lot here - everyday.
                      Currently, I am in my senior year. I try to learn from everyone here. I also try to help
                    others as much as possible. I lived in Rajasthan for a couple of years  - which was awesome.
